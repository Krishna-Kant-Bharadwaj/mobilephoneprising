# ðŸ“± Mobile Price Classification

This project predicts the *price range of mobile phones* (0â€“3) using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.  
The dataset includes specifications like battery power, RAM, pixel height/width, etc., and the task is to classify phones into four price ranges.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is mobile_price.csv.  
It contains phone specifications and the target variable price_range:
- 0 â†’ Low cost  
- 1 â†’ Medium cost  
- 2 â†’ High cost  
- 3 â†’ Very high cost  

> Upload the dataset to your Google Drive if running in *Google Colab*, or place it in the project folder if running locally.
